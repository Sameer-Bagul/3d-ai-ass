Build a complete end-to-end repo that implements a 3D AI avatar platform (client + server) from the existing root which already contains plan.md and the VRM model 4430289322881048059.vrm; create every file, folder, and scripts needed so the project is immediately runnable and easy to extend. Requirements in brief (do this automatically): server in Node.js (JavaScript) with Express and WebSocket support, REST endpoints (/api/chat for LLM prompts, /api/stream for streaming responses, /api/tts to synthesize or proxy TTS, /api/align for phoneme alignment, /api/finetune to manage Ollama/Mistral fine-tuning workflows, /api/assets to serve models/assets), secure handling of API keys (env vars + example .env.example), Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for server + optional local Ollama service, and tests. Client is a Vite + React + TypeScript app using @react-three/fiber, three, and @pixiv/three-vrm to load the VRM, with modules for AvatarCanvas, AvatarController (phoneme→blendshape scheduler, head/eye procedural engine), audio (WebAudio scheduling + amplitude analysis), and transport (WebSocket client to receive real-time animation commands). Provide a consistent folder structure, useful npm scripts (start, dev, build, lint, format, test), CI config (GitHub Actions for lint/test/build), and a detailed README.md with run instructions, architecture diagram description, and how to fine-tune Mistral on Ollama (data format, training command examples, model promotion). Implement sample stubs: a working minimal chat flow (user message → server calls Ollama Mistral → server returns text), TTS proxy that returns audio and dummy phoneme JSON (so front-end can demo lip-sync), an example phoneme JSON timeline, and a sample plan.md-driven task runner that references the VRM file. Ensure all code is well-commented, include ESLint/Prettier configs, and provide a single script (e.g., ./scripts/bootstrap.sh) that creates the entire folder tree and files with placeholder content so a developer or another AI agent can run bash ./scripts/bootstrap.sh to generate the full project scaffold.
